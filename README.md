## Project Summary

This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a books sales dataset.  
The goal is to extract commercially meaningful insights that help understand pricing behavior, customer engagement, genre performance, stock patterns, and overall revenue potential.

The analysis blends data exploration with business interpretation, providing decision-ready insights for publishers, online bookstores, and retail managers.

## Key Business Insights

### 1. High Review Count Strongly Predicts Visibility and Sales
Books with the highest review volumes consistently dominate top-rated and high-selling categories.  
Review volume is a reliable indicator of market visibility and long-term demand.

### 2. Certain Genres Have Higher Pricing Power
Some genres consistently show higher average prices.  
This suggests strong customer willingness to pay, allowing retailers to strategically set premium pricing within these categories.

### 3. Ratings Alone Do Not Predict Revenue
Several books with excellent ratings have low prices or limited stock.  
Revenue potential depends on the combined effect of:
- rating  
- price  
- available stock  

A high rating only indicates quality, not profitability.

### 4. Revenue Is Concentrated Among a Small Group of Books
The analysis shows that a small percentage of books contribute the majority of estimated revenue.  
This follows the Pareto Principle: roughly 20% of titles generate 80% of income.

### 5. Publishers With Larger Catalogs Hold Market Advantage
Publishers releasing more titles display stronger market presence and higher likelihood of customer trust.  
For retailers, these publishers represent valuable long-term partnerships.

### 6. Recently Published Books Tend to Perform Better
Books published in recent years show higher average ratings and stronger customer engagement.  
Factors include improved writing quality, better marketing, and stronger reader communities.

### 7. High-Rated Books With Low Stock Indicate Missed Revenue
Several books rated above 4.5 have extremely low stock levels.  
These represent immediate restocking opportunities because demand is already proven.
